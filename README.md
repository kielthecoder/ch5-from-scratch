# ch5-from-scratch

This is a very simple walk-through CH5 project.  It is organized as different branches
so you can follow along with the blog at <https://kielthecoder.com/>.

## Getting Started

You will want to start off with Part 1, so you should immediately run:

> git checkout part-1

And if you want to be able to try new things and still revert back to my Part 1, you could

> git checkout -b my-part-1

And put all your changes in there.
